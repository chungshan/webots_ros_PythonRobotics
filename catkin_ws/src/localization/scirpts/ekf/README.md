# Extended Kalman Filter
EKF is a nonlinear version of Kalman filter by linearizing the system dynamics.

If you don't understand EKF, I recommend reading these materials:

* [Understanding Kalman Filters (MathWorks)](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/series/understanding-kalman-filters.html)

* [Extended Kalman filter (wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter)
